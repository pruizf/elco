collect				
all				
three				
points				
from				
their				
opening

Bitar	I	Salem Bitar		
appeared				
to				
have				
covered				
but				
then				
allowed				
to				
slip				
into				
the				
net				
.				

It				
was				
the				
second				
costly				
blunder				
by				
Syria	B	Syria	Syria_national_football_team	
in				
four				
minutes				
.				

Defender				
Hassan	B	Hassan Abbas	Hassan_Abbas	
Abbas	I	Hassan Abbas	Hassan_Abbas

the				
lead				
with				
a				
well-struck				
header

the				
seventh				
minute

laid				
siege				
to				
the				
Syrian	B	Syrian	Syria_national_football_team	
penalty				
area				
for				
most				
of				
the				
game

forced				
to				
rely

that

would				
be

is

the

Analysts				
predict				
Santa	B	Santa Fe

go

and				
that				
if

,				
Newmont	B	Newmont	Newmont_Mining_Corporation

about

Maurice	B	Maurice Baril	Maurice_Baril	
Baril	I	Maurice Baril	Maurice_Baril	
told				
a				
news				
conference				
in				
Nairobi	B	Nairobi	Nairobi	
his				
main				
concern				
was				
for				
a				
large				
group				
of				
about				
150,000				
refugees				
living				
off				
the				
land				
in				
a

about				
65				
km				
(				
40				
miles				
)				
west				
of				
the				
eastern				
city				
of				
Goma	B	Goma	Goma	
.				

If				
he				
decided				
it				
was				
necessary				
and				
safe				
for				
the				
aircrew				
,				
he				
would				
not				
hesitate				
to				
order				
airdrops				
of				
food				
for				
the				
refugees				
,				
even				
against				
the				
wishes				
of				
the				
government				
in				
Kinshasa	B	Kinshasa	Kinshasa	
and				
the				
Zairean	B	Zairean	Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo	
rebels				
who				
control				
much				
of

he				
said

"				
Tomorrow				
I				
'm				
going				
into

my				
intention				
is				
to				
go				
across				
into				
eastern				
Zaire	B	Zaire	Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo	
and				
try				
to				
find				
out				
for				
the

what				
the				
situation				
is				
on				
the				
ground				
,				
"				
he

saw				
rebel				
leader				
Laurent	B	Laurent Kabila	Laurent-Désiré_Kabila	
Kabila	I	Laurent Kabila	Laurent-Désiré_Kabila	
in				
Goma	B	Goma	Goma	
last				
week				
but				
the				
rebels				
told				
him				
the				
crisis				
was				
over				
because				
most				
of				
the				
Rwandan	B	Rwandan	Rwanda	
refugees				
have				
already				
gone				
home				
.				

The				
rebels				
do				
not				
want				
the				
multinational				
force				
to				
deploy				
on				
the				
ground				
,				
for				
fear				
it				
might				
help				
the				
Zairean	B	Zairean	Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo	
army				
regain				
control				
of				
the				
area				
.				

Kinshasa	B	Kinshasa	Kinshasa	
opposes				
airdrops				
,				
apparently				
because				
the				
food				
could				
fall				
into				
the				
hands				
of				
the				
rebels				
and				
their				
local				
supporters				
.

would				
probably				
not				
have				
to				
make				
food				
airdrops				
or				
intervene				
militarily				
in				
any				
major				
way				
.				

"				
It				
does				
n't				
look				
as				
though				
they				
(				
airdrops				
)				
are				
going				
to				
be				
required				
in				
any				
significant				
way				
because				
the				
NGOs

,				
"				
Young	B	Young	Douglas_Young	
told				
reporters				
.				

But				
General				
Baril	B	Baril	Maurice_Baril	
said				
it				
would				
be				
premature				
to				
rule				
out				
any				
course				
of				
action				
until				
he				
had				
more				
information				
.				

"				
We				
hope				
that				
if				
the				
front				
moves				
forward				
or				
stabilises				
then				
we				
will				
have				
access				
(				
to				
the				
large				
group				
of				
refugees				
)				
with				
reconnaissance				
or				
humanitarian				
agencies				
.				

"				
If				
they				
ca				
n't				
move				
because				
they				
are				
too				
weak				
,				
then				
we				
will				
probably				
consider				
very				
seriously				
using				
air				
delivery				
means				
(				
airdrops				
)				
...It				
's				
complex				
,				
it				
's				
dangerous				
for				
the				
air				
crew				
that				
fly				
in				
there				
and				
it				
will				
have				
to				
be				
absolutely				
necessary				
.				

If				
it				
is				
necessary				
,				
I				
wo				
n't				
hesitate				
to				
use				
it				
,				
"				
he				
said

Asked				
if				
he				
would				
disregard				
the				
objections				
of				
the				
Zairean	B	Zairean	Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo

,				
he				
said				
:				
"				
It

by

with				
the

is				
booming

spend				
much				
of

said				
the				
organisers				
of				
a				
four-day				
international				
plastic

conference				
that				
opened				
on

The				
number				
of

in

has				
jumped				
30				
percent				
to				
an				
estimated				
150,000				
this

The				
number				
of

on

increased				
even				
more				
--				
by				
80				
percent				
,				
from

Our

"				
Hakme	B	Hakme		
said				
.				

"				
We				
believe				
the				
increase				
in				
plastic				
surgeries				
for				
men				
results				
from				
the				
difficulties				
in				
the				
job				
market				
.				

People				
need				
to				
have				
a				
more				
youthful				
look				
to				
compete				
in				
the				
job				
market				
,				
given				
the				
profound				
changes				
in				
Latin	B	Latin America	Latin_America	
America	I	Latin America	Latin_America	
's				
economy				
.				
"				

A				
controlled				
exchange				
rate				
,				
trade				
liberalisation				
and				
tight				
monetary				
policies				
have				
also				
dramatically				
curbed				
inflation				
,				
making				
more				
money				
available				
for				
cosmetic				
surgery				
.				

Brazil	B	Brazil	Brazil	
has				
been				
at				
the				
forefront				
in				
plastic				
surgery				
for				
decades

home				
to				
one				
of				
the				
most				
famous				
surgeons				
,				
Ivo	B	Ivo Pitangy		
Pitangy	I	Ivo Pitangy		
.				

There				
are				
6,000				
plastic				
surgeons				
there				
,				
of				
which				
4,500				
have				
qualified				
to				
be				
members

the				
SBCP	B	SBCP

Every

medical				
students				
from				
all				
over				
the				
world				
come				
to				
study				
there				
.				

Hakme	B	Hakme		
attributes				
Brazil	B	Brazil	Brazil	
's				
fascination				
with				
plastic				
surgery				
not				
to				
excessive				
vanity				
but				
to				
the				
country				
's				
mix				
and				
match				
of				
different				
races				
,				
which				
can				
create				
physical				
disharmonies

"				

What				
happens				
is				
the				
nose				
sometimes				
does				
n't				
match				
the				
mouth				
or				
the				
buttocks				
do				
n't				
match				
with				
the				
legs				
,				
"				
he				
said

Brazil	B	Brazil	Brazil	
's				
most				
sought-after				
beauty				
treatment				
is				
liposuction				
in				
which				
fat				
is				
sucked				
away				
from				
areas

with				
about				
30,000				
operations				
a				
year				
at				
a				
cost				
of				
$				
3,000				
to				
$				
4,000				
each				
.				

Stomach				
tucks				
and				
breast				
operations				
are				
also				
popular				
since				
the				
tropical				
climate				
calls				
for				
flesh-baring

unlike				
women				
elsewhere				
Brazilians	B	Brazilians	Brazil	
tend				
to

breast				
reductions

buttock				
implants

"				
The

only				
reach

One				
way				
to				
bridge				
the

to				
put

But

at

25				
years				
said				
the				
officials

might				
as

be				
trying

police

some				
600

down

setting

the

Attempts				
by				
copyright-based				
industries				
to				
ensure

get				
a				
cut				
from

led				
to				
a				
storm				
of				
protests				
by

critics

say				
the				
pacts

CANBERRA	B	CANBERRA	Canberra	
1996-12-06				

The				
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	
opposition				
on				
Friday				
demanded				
a				
high-powered				
investigation				
into				
paedophilia				
in				
the				
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	
diplomatic				
service				
after				
the				
federal				
court				
forced				
the				
head				
of				
the				
existing				
inquiry				
to				
stand				
aside				
.				

The				
court				
said				
inquiry				
head				
Chris	B	Chris Hunt		
Hunt	I	Chris Hunt		
might				
be				
biased				
,				
since				
he				
privately

no				
major				
evidence

paedophile				
activity

he				
still				
had				
months				
'				
of				
investigation				
before				
him				
.				

"				
Today				
we				
are

with				
a				
ruinous				
wreck

From				
a

ensure				
the

run				
without

the

probably				
not				
be

concerned				
about				
some				
of				
the

the				
more				
educated

will				
realise

ahead
